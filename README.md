# HTML-Document-Visualizer

### Introduction
With the introduction of DOM structure for HTML in HTML-5, the layout of HTML documents have been reorganized. An HTML document is now treated as a document with nested elements. But is becomes extremely difficult for people to understand the structure of an HTML document and the intended workflow. To make things easy HTML Document Visualizer will help to form a tree from any HTML document (Sizes less than 200 MB). This will not only save some time in analysis of a document but also give an overview of the structure of documents.

### Packages Used:
- Beautiful Soup (for scrapping headless documents)
- Graphviz (converting contents into graphical visualizations)
- Streamlit (for the web UI)
